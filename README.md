A Dynamic Ticket Pricing Solution for the NFL Team

Our study explored two solutions to optimize revenue with dynamic pricing for the Indianapolis Colts. While one approach focusses on revenue maximization, the other explores bridging the revenue gap between the primary and secondary markets and suggesting primary prices based on historical secondary market data.

On implementing solution two on the primary data for 2019, we realized a potential revenue increase of  10% ($125,000) by setting solution two's suggested price. 

Our next steps would be an extension to the project, by adding consideration of customers buying patterns and other characteristics that might enhance the reliability of the revenue optimization model.
